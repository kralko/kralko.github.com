title: justifying ARMY WIVES

in general, i make no apologies for the things i watch. i find it much less taxing to just watch what i want and then worry about whether it was worthy.

it was harder, however, for me to justify ARMY WIVES, the Lifetime show that began in 2007 and began its fifth season in march. from the melodrama to the low rent music, it was below even my standards for something to which i'll dedicate significant time.

the mixture of strong female characters, a military setting and a commitment to displaying all sides, even the unsavory, of motherhood won me over eventually. when i caught up to the current episode, i cried real tears at the death of a character i knew only tangentially.

my academic writing centers on military life, usually the soldiers deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan who feature so prominently in documentaries like GUNNER PALACE (Tucker 2005) or IRAQ IN FRAGMENTS (Longley 2006). with some notable exceptions (Lynndie England in Morris' 2008 STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE comes to mind), these are male films in terms of both creators and content. this is not to say that gender is ignored or pushed aside in these films, and i might even argue that it is the burden of male-ness that unites so many of the soldiers shown. but in terms of simple face time, women are less represented in the armed forces and thus, the films that capture the military life.

ARMY WIVES plugs this hole in a simple but incomplete way for me. female characters dealing with female issues fill the screen - choosing between career and family, the burden of domesticity, the necessary subordination of person to the needs of both the family and the Army. the moral implications of the war haunt the edges of the narrative, but are easily subsumed by the force of the women, the "tribe"; they hold together in the face of adversity supporting their families without thought to the political fallout of such a choice.

do the day to day tasks of women on base somehow seem closer to me than the disarming of IEDs? have i fallen into the trap of only seeking out those images which reflect, even partially, my life as i've conceived it? is it simply easier to participate in war media when the text refuses to engage with the political reality? 

i have no easy answers to these questions. i'll continue to watch under the cover of "professional necessity", and with some of the highest ratings the network has ever seen, i won't be alone.
