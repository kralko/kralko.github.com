so many questions arise when you plan to start a website. where will you host it? what colors will you use? which features will you highlight in the design? will you capitalize your letters?

i was raised, in an intellectual sense, to be curious about everything. pushed hard into math and science, i was anxious to learn as much as i could about the way the world worked in a quantitative way, until i pretty much flunked calc III.

after literally dragging my finger up and down the course catalog, i spent the majority of my freshman year taking prerequisite classes, in modern greek culture and french and film studies and english composition. blown away by the force of the material in my ‘classical film theory’ seminar, i never looked back but have remained undecided in my interests.

this post is titled ‘hello world’ because that is the first file you make in any introduction to programming class. a program that prints out the text you put into it, it seemed an apt metaphor for beginning this venture.

i’ve purposefully eschewed the standard web publishing tools in order to host through git hub, a repository for open source code. this is truly a new project for me, as i know little about coding for the web, or even really coding in general. it is my dream that this site, through the accumulation and (anticipated? desired?) increasing sophistication of both the content and its form, will serve as record of my work, both personal and professional, as i move forward.

hello, world.
