feeling a little out of sorts today, so made up this quick lunch with light, fresh flavors. still hungry for a burger, but, alas.

smash a clove of garlic and put it in a medium high pan with a tablespoon of olive oil. sautee for a minute, and then add chopped asparagus, with the zest and juice of one lemon, as well as salt and pepper. with skinny early asparagus, it only needs maybe four minutes to soften up but not lose its green color. add cooked pasta of your choice to the pan and cook together to let 'sauce' coat pasta. add sauteed shrimp if you so please.
