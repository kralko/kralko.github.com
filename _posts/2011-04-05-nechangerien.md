living in los angeles, i have the rare privilege of being able to see many films before they're distributed widely, and many that may never see distribution. although i am generally adverse to discussing films, especially immediately after the lights come up and even more so if i enjoyed the film, there is a connection that is born out of shared experience. 

as part of the AFI fest in 2009, i saw Pedro Costa's NE CHANGE RIEN, a gorgeous film that details the musical endeavors of the french actress Jeanne Balibar. from the smoke in the air to the vulnerability that filled every frame, it was moving, gentle and focused, different enough from COLLOSAL YOUTH (2006) but linked enough through its visual sensability to Costa's ouevre to feel cohesive. 

i want everyone i know to see this film. since that screening, it has shown in new york city, but for the most part, it remains elusive. it comes back to me when i sit alone at night in the dark, unable to sleep when my mind is full and my body restless. i am reduced to watching this video, over and over:
<object width="480" height="390"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/XVbndxHyiXg?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/XVbndxHyiXg?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="390"></embed></object>

like the perfect meal you ate but could never recreate, there is a certain beauty in the one-off screening. like many film students, i am conditioned to watch and rewatch films until they turn into texts. films that were fully visceral experiences when seen for the first time are transformed into objects of study, like learning how a hoax worked after a magician has duped you. like pt barnum, this for me does not reduce the power of the first experience, but instead leads to a deeper understanding of past experiences while retaining the power of the magic you felt in the first place. 

NE CHANGE RIEN is a film that retains its magic, even a full 18 months after it screened. it has not yet exposed its secrets to me, leaving me with only the memory of how it made me feel, what it made me think about, the night i watched it, the lights of the city as i drove home. it is the type of memory i drag back up when i feel that all my viewing is rote and sterile, a reminder that i can and should still watch primarily for the love of the medium.

i may get a chance to share this film and learn its secrets when cinema guild [releases it](http://www.indiewire.com/article/2011/03/30/cinema_guild_takes_ne_change_rein_for_dvd_and_vod "releases it") this year. as i prepare to move from los angeles to ann arbor this summer, i am certainly grateful that dvd and vod are becoming increasingly common options for me to see films other than mass market wide releases, despite my commitment to seeing whatever i can on 35mm. 

above all, i want to remember that film is more than the next seminar paper or dissertation fodder. film is something that can haunt you, refusing to surrender its magic, filling your mind when you least expect it. the one-off screening is frustrating when you want to own it, rewatch it, carry it with you with the same reverence as a well worn favorite book or family photo; the one-off screening is the reminder i need that film is more than texts i can control, but their power can exceed me, overwhelm me, if i'm open to it.
